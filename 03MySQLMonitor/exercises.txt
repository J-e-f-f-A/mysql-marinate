1. What do we mean when we say that MySQL has a client-server architecture?
    There are two parts - the MySQL Database server which serves the Database requests,
    and the MySQL Client(s) that interact with the server to Query/Update/Populate the Database.


2. Use the monitor help to look up information on the SELECT statement. (Weâ€™ll discuss SELECT in detail in Chapter 5.)

mysql> help select;
Name: 'SELECT'
Description:
Syntax:
SELECT
    [ALL | DISTINCT | DISTINCTROW ]
      [HIGH_PRIORITY]
      [STRAIGHT_JOIN]
      [SQL_SMALL_RESULT] [SQL_BIG_RESULT] [SQL_BUFFER_RESULT]
      [SQL_CACHE | SQL_NO_CACHE] [SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS]
    select_expr [, select_expr ...]
    [FROM table_references
    [WHERE where_condition]
    [GROUP BY {col_name | expr | position}
      [ASC | DESC], ... [WITH ROLLUP]]
    [HAVING where_condition]
    [ORDER BY {col_name | expr | position}
      [ASC | DESC], ...]
    [LIMIT {[offset,] row_count | row_count OFFSET offset}]
    [PROCEDURE procedure_name(argument_list)]
    [INTO OUTFILE 'file_name'
        [CHARACTER SET charset_name]
        export_options
      | INTO DUMPFILE 'file_name'
      | INTO var_name [, var_name]]
    [FOR UPDATE | LOCK IN SHARE MODE]]

SELECT is used to retrieve rows selected from one or more tables, and
can include UNION statements and subqueries. See [HELP UNION], and
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/subqueries.html.

The most commonly used clauses of SELECT statements are these:

o Each select_expr indicates a column that you want to retrieve. There
  must be at least one select_expr.

o table_references indicates the table or tables from which to retrieve
  rows. Its syntax is described in [HELP JOIN].

o The WHERE clause, if given, indicates the condition or conditions
  that rows must satisfy to be selected. where_condition is an
  expression that evaluates to true for each row to be selected. The
  statement selects all rows if there is no WHERE clause.

  In the WHERE expression, you can use any of the functions and
  operators that MySQL supports, except for aggregate (summary)
  functions. See
  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/expressions.html, and
  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/functions.html.

SELECT can also be used to retrieve rows computed without reference to
any table.

3. What is the difference between using the monitor in interactive mode and using
the monitor in batch mode?

Interactive mode is when you enter commands from a terminal.
Batch mode is when you specify a MySQL command file to execute, either by redirecting stdin or with the 'SOURCE filename'
command.

4. What do the monitor user, password, and database options do?

Allow you to connect with a different user or database than the default.
